Query-defined concepts imply subqueries with existentials. To get this to work correctly in general, we need to implement a global consistency algorithm that is aware of whether each variable is part of the top-level, visible query.

Example:

(define-category (bar C)
  (concepts
    [A' baz]
    [B' baz]
    [C baz])
  (edges
    [e1 : A' foo B]
    [e2 : B' foo C]
    [e3 : C foo A]))

(query
  (concepts
    [A bar]
    [B bar]
    [C bar])
  (edges
    [e1 : A foo B]
    [e2 : B foo C]
    [e3 : C foo A]))

Or, safe-drug query. We only want one copy of the drug, though there are multiple diseases it safely treats.

For now we will pre-compute categories like safe-drug. To then use these precomputed categories, we need an extension to query/graph that accepts a list of curies.

Greg:
 * add list of curies feature
 * add safe-drug and human-gene precomputed lists

Next time:
 * write logic to get globally consistent results out of ranked-paths.
